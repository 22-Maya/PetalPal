# PetalPal

PetalPal is a smart plant pot connected to a companion app that allows novice gardeners to learn about planting and enables busy gardeners to avoid worrying about watering schedules.

How to build to see our app on your own computer/device:
- 1st download XCode on your Mac from the App Store. You may need to update your Mac for this
- open up Terminal and navigate to whatever folder you want to save the project
- clone this repository by typing "git clone https://github.com/22-Maya/PetalPal" and press enter (don't include quotes)
- after the cloning is finished, you should see a new folder with the name PetalPal 
- inside of the PetalPal folder, open it and you'll see a LICENSE, README, and another PetalPal folder. Open up the 2nd petalpal folder and you should see a file named PetalPal.xcodeproj. Double click this file to open it in Xcode.
- at the top middle it should say PetalPal > Any iOS Device. hover over the part that says any ios device and then select iPhone 16 under iOS simulators. 
- then click the play button on the left
- it will take a bit to build, but in 1-2 min it should say build suceeded
- you should have a new app opened called Simulator. itll take a while to load in since the simulator is usually very slow. but eventually it should open up our app, petalpal (it may bring you to the home screen instead, click on the petalpal icon to open)
- now you're able to test our app! feel free to register an account and check it our. currently the wifi screen is just a simulator so don't change the address, but everything else is working.
